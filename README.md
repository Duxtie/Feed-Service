## Installation

Make sure you have Docker and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) installed.

1. Ensure you are in the `the root directory` directory
2. Run `docker-compose up -d` (this will download and build the various images)
3. Visit `http://localhost:8001/docs`
4. Use the `feed_upload_exmaple.xml` to run test upload
